### Testing
- Black Box Testing
    - Focuses on Input and Output
    - Represents the views of the users
    - Tests the following
        - Functionality
        - User input validation
        - Output results
        - State transitions
        - Boundary cases and off-by-one errors
- Grey Box Testing
    - Is like black box testing, but you can can peek
    - Allows you to dig around a little to ensure the system works as it's supposed to below
    the surface
    - Tests the following
        - Verifying auditing and logging
        - Data designed for other systems
        - System-added information
        - Scraps left laying around
- White Box Testing
    - Is the deepest level of testing
    - Allows one to see exactly what's going on inside the code
    - Is typically completed code-on-code, rather than exercised by a human
    - Tests the following
        - Testing all the different branches of code
        - Proper error handling
        - Working as documented
        - Proper handling of resource constraints

### Use Case and Use Case Diagram
**Need to be able to draw a diagram**
- Use Cases
    - Describes what a system does but now how it does it
    - Achieves a discrete goal for the user
    - May map to several use cases
    - Represent the functional requirements of the system 
        - *Note: Non-functional requirements are stated elsewhere*
- UML Use Case Diagrams
    - Describes a set of sequences
    - Represents actors with the system itself
