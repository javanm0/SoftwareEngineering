- Big Bang Development Approach
  - Start coding right away without even talking to the customer
  - No feedback during the process; if the customer isn't happy, you haven't made any progress
- Iterative Development
  - Each iteration provides working software to provide to customer
  - Book suggests an iteration every month (20 working days), but every two weeks is common (10 working days)
  - Each iteration is a mini project
  - Requirements, Design, Code, and Test each time
- Two major concerns in projects
  - Cost
    - Cost of the developer's time working
  - Time
    - Artificial Deadline
    - Hard Deadline
- Customer/Client Role
  - Ask customer what they need
  - Ask them for more detail
  - Ask them for options about how you might implement their big needs
  - What is needed, on time, and on budget
- Blueskying
  - Brainstorming with clients
  - Called this because the sky is the limit
  - Two techniques to help better understand the customer
    - Role playing
      - Pretend to be the software
      - Customer attempts to instruct you specific tasks
    - Observation
      - Watch how customers will want to work with the software
      - Figure out where software will fit in
- User Story
  - Components
    - Title
    - Description
    - Estimate
    - Priority
  - Describes one thing that the software needs to do for the customer
  - Is written using language that the customer understands
  - Is written by the customer
  - Is short and has no more than three sentences
  - Should not mention specific technologies
- Estimation
  - Each team member that's a part of the planning process has their own estimate
  - Planning Poker
    - Is used to consolidate each individual estimate to the team estimate that is then provided to the customer
    1. Place a user story in the middle of the table
    1. Give each team member a deck of 13 cards; these cards have numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence
    1. Each team member picks an estimate and places the corresponding card face down on the table
    1. Everyone turns over their cards at the same time
    1. The dealer marks the spread across the estimates
    - The larger the difference between estimates, the less confident you are in the estimate, and the more assumptions you need to root ou
    - Want to get rid of any assumptions and work with the customer to ensure that allow expectations are met 
- Utopian vs Real-World days
  - Utopian days
    - Typically what most programmers will give when asked for an estimate
    - Better-than-best-case estimate
  - Real-World days
    - 1 calendar month is equivalent to 14 days of real work
      1. Take away weekends and holidays
      1. Apply velocity to account for time spend in the office that isn't spent developing
    - Is better to under-promise and over-deliver and ensure that proper time is allocated for each iteration
- Velocity
  - Accounts for overhead in projects such as meetings, updates, etc.
  - Is applied before creating iteration length
- Big Board
  - Dashboard on an office wall to keep track of what work is in the pipeline, what's in progress, and what's done
  - User Stories and Burn Down Rate are typically here
