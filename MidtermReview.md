- Big Bang Development Approach
  - Start coding right away without even talking to the customer
  - No feedback during the process; if the customer isn't happy, you haven't made any progress
- Iterative Development
  - Each iteration provides working software to provide to customer
  - Book suggests an iteration every month (20 working days), but every two weeks is common (10 working days)
  - Each iteration is a mini project
  - Requirements, Design, Code, and Test each time
- Two major concerns in projects
  - Cost
    - Cost of the developer's time working
  - Time
    - Artificial Deadline
    - Hard Deadline
- Customer/Client Role
  - Ask customer what they need
  - Ask them for more detail
  - Ask them for options about how you might implement their big needs
  - What is needed, on time, and on budget
- Blueskying
  - Brainstorming with clients
  - Called this because the sky is the limit
  - Two techniques to help better understand the customer
    - Role playing
      - Pretend to be the software
      - Customer attempts to instruct you specific tasks
    - Observation
      - Watch how customers will want to work with the software
      - Figure out where software will fit in
- User Story
  - Components
    - Title
    - Description
    - Estimate
    - Priority
  - Describes one thing that the software needs to do for the customer
  - Is written using language that the customer understands
  - Is written by the customer
  - Is short and has no more than three sentences
  - Should not mention specific technologies
- Estimation
  - Each team member that's a part of the planning process has their own estimate
  - Planning Poker
    - Is used to consolidate each individual estimate to the team estimate that is then provided to the customer
    1. Place a user story in the middle of the table
    1. Give each team member a deck of 13 cards; these cards have numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence
    1. Each team member picks an estimate and places the corresponding card face down on the table
    1. Everyone turns over their cards at the same time
    1. The dealer marks the spread across the estimates
    - The larger the difference between estimates, the less confident you are in the estimate, and the more assumptions you need to root ou
    - Want to get rid of any assumptions and work with the customer to ensure that allow expectations are met 
- Utopian vs Real-World days
  - Utopian days
    - Typically what most programmers will give when asked for an estimate
    - Better-than-best-case estimate
  - Real-World days
    - 1 calendar month is equivalent to 14 days of real work
      1. Take away weekends and holidays
      1. Apply velocity to account for time spend in the office that isn't spent developing
    - Is better to under-promise and over-deliver and ensure that proper time is allocated for each iteration
- Velocity
  - Accounts for overhead in projects such as meetings, updates, etc.
  - Is applied before creating iteration length
- Big Board
  - Dashboard on an office wall to keep track of what work is in the pipeline, what's in progress, and what's done
  - User Stories and Burn Down Rate are typically here
- Good-Enough Design
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - Each object in the system should have a single responsibility
    - All the object's services should be focused on carrying out that single responsibility
  - Don't Repeate Yourself (DRY)
    - Avoid duplicate code by abstracting or separating out things that are commond and placing those things in a single location
    - Has each piece of information and behavious in your system in a single, sensible place
  - Ripple effect - one small change to software can cause a ripple of changes throughout your code
- Version Control
  - After an editor and compiler, the version control is the most crucial tool for software development
  - Software Configuration Management
    - Tracking and controlling changes to files used in software development
    - Based on revision control (version control)
    - Used for managing builds and release
    - Used for accounting and auditing of process and product
  - diff and patch
    - Distribute changes efficiently
    - Simplistic form of handling versions
    - diff utility creates a patch file
    - The patch utility applies the patch file to the starting code to create the updated filem
  - Version control is essential to coordinating changes among collaborating devs
  - Dessential to a solitary dev working on anything non-trivial
  - Text files 
    - Only understands the lexical level (i.e., a source-code file is a file of characters)
    - Does not understand structure of code
    - Does not know what a while statement is
  - Binary files
    - Stays on the file level
  - File locking 
    - Only one dev at a time has acces to a file or resource
    - Lock-Modify-Unlock - one dev at a time has the "token" and other devs have to wait
    - Pros: No merging problems
    - Cons: Prevents other devs from working; impractical in distributed development due to time/space differences
  - Version Merging
    - No restrictions on access
    - Devs can work simultaneously
    - Copy-Modify-Merge
    - Pros: No restrictions on working
    - Cons: Merge Issues
  - Current Practice
    - Most version control users implement Version Merging
    - File Locking is typically only used for binary files (e.g., MS Word files)
    - Some old projects and developers use File Locking
  - Centralized Version Control
    - Examples: Subversion (SVN), ClearCase, Vault
    - Has a single central repo and local working copies
    - Access controlled by the server 
    - One sequence of version numbers    
    - Traditional approach
  - SVN
    - Remote Repository
      - The single, central SVN repo is typically running on a remote machine
    - Working Copy
      - *Is not* a local repository
      - Is only the code that you've checked out into your file system
      - Where you modify your files
    - URLs identify location of central repo and directories/files in central repo
    - Each commit has an author
    - Support for per-dir permissions
    - Cons:
      - Need server to create a shared repo
      - No distinction between private and public changes
      - Merging is difficult
      - Branching creates problems
  - Distributed Version Control
    - Examples: Git, Bazaar, Darcs, Mercurial, Monotone, SVK
    - Peer-to-peer, no central repo; all are repo copies
    - No one sequence of version numbers
    - Access controlled by server
  - Git
    - Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernal development
    - Used by major companies like Microsoft and Apple
    - Repository
      - Stored in hidden dir .git
      - What you clone from another repo
    - Working Copy
      - The code you checkout into your filesystem
      - The files that you see
      - Where you modify the file
    - Each commit has a hash - currently SHA1
    - URL only identifies the location of the repo
    - Each commit has an author and a committer
    - Peer-to-peer
    - Each copy is a full-fledged repo and can be worked on locally without access to central server
    - Each user clones the repo, makes changes, and pushes the changes
    - Pros:
      - Records complete new version
      - Handles local and remote repos
      - Tracks merged data
      - Stages changes 
      - Fast, flexible, powerful, and multiuser
    - Cons:
      - Can be challenging to learn
      - GUI tools less developed than SVN tools
  - GitHub
    - Hosting service for Git
    - Founded in 2008, purchased by Microsoft in 2018
    - 372 million repos, with 28 million public repos, and 100 millions users
