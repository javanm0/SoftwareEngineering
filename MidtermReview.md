- Big Bang Development Approach
  - Start coding right away without even talking to the customer
  - No feedback during the process; if the customer isn't happy, you haven't made any progress
- Iterative Development
  - Each iteration provides working software to provide to customer
  - Book suggests an iteration every month (20 working days), but every two weeks is common (10 working days)
  - Each iteration is a mini project
  - Requirements, Design, Code, and Test each time
- Two major concerns in projects
  - Cost
    - Cost of the developer's time working
  - Time
    - Artificial Deadline
    - Hard Deadline
- Customer/Client Role
  - Ask customer what they need
  - Ask them for more detail
  - Ask them for options about how you might implement their big needs
  - What is needed, on time, and on budget
- Blueskying
  - Brainstorming with clients
  - Called this because the sky is the limit
  - Two techniques to help better understand the customer
    - Role playing
      - Pretend to be the software
      - Customer attempts to instruct you specific tasks
    - Observation
      - Watch how customers will want to work with the software
      - Figure out where software will fit in
- User Story
  - Components
    - Title
    - Description
    - Estimate
    - Priority
  - Describes one thing that the software needs to do for the customer
  - Is written using language that the customer understands
  - Is written by the customer
  - Is short and has no more than three sentences
  - Should not mention specific technologies
